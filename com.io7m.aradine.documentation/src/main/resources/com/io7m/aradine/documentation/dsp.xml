        The modules included with the <Term type="package">aradine</Term> package are intended to provide strong
        guarantees in terms of producing reproducible output decades into the future. It is typical for musicians to make
        creative use of edge-case behaviour in both software and hardware DSP systems, which can lead to problems if that
        behaviour happens to be considered to be a bug by the original author and suddenly fixed one day; suddenly the
        musician can no longer get the sounds that they liked out of the system!

      <Paragraph>
        The intention is that once a DSP module is published, only "bugs" that lead to outright crashes will be fixed;
        everything else is considered to be the exported "behaviour" of that module and will be preserved in perpetuity.
        Additionally, extensive unit tests are written for each module in the hope that changes in behaviour will be
        caught and corrected before those changes make it into a release.
